# Exploit-dev Repo

This repo will contain my local exploit development scripts from 2010. I put here for archival purposes.

## Getting Started

If you want to test my script, please test in the development environment. Use virtual machine and host-only network to isolate the network.

### Prerequisites

Target operating system is Windows (various from Windows XP to Windows 10), and it's written in Python. You will need Python for Windows.

### Vulnerable Softwares

Vulnerable softwares can be found in oldversion (http://www.oldversion.com/) or oldapps (http://www.oldapps.com/). You can also search it on exploit-db (https://www.exploit-db.com) to match my exploits.

### Running the exploit

You know how to do it right?!
