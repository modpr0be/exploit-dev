# Exploit-dev Repo

This repo will contain my local exploit development scripts from 2010. I put here for archival purposes.

## Getting Started

If you want to test my script, please test in the development environment. Use virtual machine and host-only network to isolate the network.

### Prerequisites

Target operating system is Windows (various from Windows XP to Windows 10), and most scripts are written in Python. Whatever your attacking machine, you will need Python for the OS.

### Vulnerable Softwares

Vulnerable softwares can be found in oldversion (http://www.oldversion.com/) or oldapps (http://www.oldapps.com/). You can also search it on exploit-db (https://www.exploit-db.com) to match my exploits.

### Running the exploit

You know how to do it right?!

## Disclaimer

My scripts have been created purely for the purposes of academic research and for the development of effective defensive techniques, and is not intended to be used to attack systems except where explicitly authorized. I am not responsible or liable for misuse of the software. Use responsibly.
